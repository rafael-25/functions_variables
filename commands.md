# File Paths and Commands

File paths are the addresses used to specify the location of
files or directories within a computer's file system.

## Relative Path:
A file path that starts from the current directory.

## Absolute Path:
A file path that starts from the root directory (/) and specifies the complete location of a file or folder.

## Path Commands:
- `/`  → root directory
- `.`  → current directory
- `..` → parent directory

- `mkdir` → create a directory
- `rmdir` → remove a directory
- `cd`    → change directories
- `pwd`   → print current path
- `ls`    → list all directories and files in the current directory

## File Management:
- `touch` → create a file
- `rm`    → remove a file
- `cp`    → copy file contents to a new file
- `mv`    → move or rename a file
